#Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal learning space where I'm becoming a full-stack web developer step by step. I'm following both a paid bootcamp and some amazing free tutorials to build real projects and sharpen my skills.

#ðŸŽ“ What Iâ€™m learning from:
Programming Hero Web Development Bootcamp (Bengali):
A full journey from beginner to MERN stack developer â€” with 1000+ videos, 45+ hands-on projects, and 12+ assignments. Covers everything from HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, React, Firebase to Node.js, MongoDB, and more.

Sigma Web Development Course by CodeWithHarry (Hindi):
A free and beginner-friendly YouTube playlist taught in Hindi. It helps me understand the basics and build real-world projects at my own pace.

#âœ¨ Why this repo?
I'm using this repo to keep track of everything Iâ€™m learning. Itâ€™s my digital notebook and progress tracker. ðŸ™‚
