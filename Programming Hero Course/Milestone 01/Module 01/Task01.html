   <div>Our home is in Tangail but since my father works in Gazipur our whole family lives there. My younger uncle works
      in Sylhet, he is a school teacher. So once after my exams during the holidays we went to visit my uncle’s house in
      Sylhet. The house my uncle lived in belonged to someone who lived abroad in London with his family. They had let
      my uncle live there for free, he just had to keep the place clean. That was his only responsibility.

      It was a huge house. The owner must have a big heart to let someone stay there like that. They clearly had good
      money, otherwise how would they afford such a big house and live in London too? Sometimes the owner and his family
      would come to Bangladesh, stay for a bit and then leave again.

      We stayed in that house for quite a while. From there my uncle rented a car and took us to visit Jaflong. Jaflong
      is a tourist spot in Sylhet division. It is about 60 km from  Sylhet town and takes around a two hours drive to
      reach there. Jaflong is located amidst tea gardens and hills. It is situated beside the river Sari in the lap of
      Hill Khashia.
